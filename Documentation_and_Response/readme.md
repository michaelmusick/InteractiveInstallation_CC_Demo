# Project Response and Documentation Guidelines

In addition to the actual devising, creation, build, and presentation of each project, you also need create documentation of your project along with a project paper.

This serves a number of purposes.

1. This encourages you to capture/document your project throughout the entire process.
2. This allows you the opportunity to create a set of deliverables that could be shared with others interested in your work (colleagues, peers, critics, galleries, etc.).
3. This process will require to reflect upon your work throughout the process, and at the end. This reflection will lead to individual and group insights, that will inevitably feedback into future iterations or projects.
4. It is critical that you learn how to discuss and present your work through written documents and videos. As you will be asked to do this constantly as a professional artist or creative.


## Collecting Documentation

Throughout the entire devising, development, iteration, build, and presentation processes you should document your project and work. This will necessarily compromise multiple forms, including, but not limited to;

- images/photos
- sketches
- mocke-ups
- mind-maps
- progress reflections
- artistic/aesthetic reflections
- pilot studies
- code snippets
- commit messages
- videos
- related work, artists, projects

You should collect all of the above and more throughout each projects life cycle. This will allow you to discuss your work more fully at the time of presentation, and in the subsequent video/paper documentation.

### Team Work

For collaborative projects, you should identify, at the start of the project, how you will share resources amongst the team. This may be one of, or a combination of, any of the following;

- GitHub Repo
- Dropbox/Google Drive/Box directory
- wordpress or medium site/account


## Reflection and Technical Paper

One of the required outputs for each project will be a Reflection and Technical Report Paper.

This paper should be written utilizing the provided course paper template, available from this directory.
