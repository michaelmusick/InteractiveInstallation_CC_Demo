# Project 1 -- Create an Experience Space with Paper

10% of your Final Grade


- **In-class critique: _Wednesday, September 20th_**
- Sketch reviews: _Wednesday, September 13th_




## Materials: paper, painters tape, parcel string

Working in teams of two, using only paper (you provide), tape (see below), & string (see below) and a location in McGill transform or create a space. This is a space that the body can travel through or be within. Ultimately, your goal is to create an experience for the body, not an object. How is this experience for the viewer different at different locations in this space?

Consider how people currently move through the space. How could you change that? Play with scale. Play with texture. Play with openings.

Consider how you can manipulate the paper – layer it, crumble it, break it into pieces, burn it, write/paint on it, fold it, hang it, etc. It has a million affordances.

The goal of this project is to begin thinking about a space and how to create space. Forget about technology or making something interactive. Object making tends to be easier than thinking about how to create spaces. This project challenges you to separate from those things, in order to think about space and scale. This class is all about creating work that takes over or is coupled with a space, not just objects & technology existing in a space/gallery.

Secure the space that you’d like to use. Let me know before the end of class on Sept 13th.

You are required to document your project (video and image) and submit copies to me one week after the critique & showing (via email). Your documentation should be placed inside of a zip'd directory, labeled with your names. (i.e. lastName1_lastName2_project1.zip)


## Critical Aspects

We share the McGill space with several other departments. Space can be tight. Don’t assume that a space will always be empty, just because it is empty when you see it. Many people work on this floor. Be mindful of that in your set-up and experiments. Don't assume that your work can just be present in the space for the entire duration. See me if you have a question or issue.

You may not block fire exits, exit signs or paths of egress. You may not block light structures with paper, as the lights get hot.

You may not use color, electronics, or sound. Work within the constraints of this assignment to explore the assignment particulars.

You may not use nails, glue, other tape or other mechanisms of adherence to the building beyond the tape given or string. I will provide the string and tape that you are allowed to use to attach to the space. You are welcome to use other tape/string of your own in the construction of elements that will constitute your work. (i.e. Use only the blue painters tape and string to connect to the walls/ceiling/floor. Use the painters tape, string, or your own tape/string for paper that is attached only to itself.)

Projects that violate these terms will be removed and will be the responsibility of the student.

You are responsible for removing your project after the critique. It must be removed that evening. Work that is not removed by 11pm will receive a 1/3 letter deduction for every 4 hours it remains in place after the critique.
