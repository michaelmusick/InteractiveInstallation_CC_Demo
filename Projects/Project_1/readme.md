# Project 1 -- Create a Sound Experience in a Space with Paper

10% of your Final Grade


- **In-class critique: _Day 4_**
- Sketch reviews: _Day 4_



## Materials: paper, painters tape, parcel string

Working in teams of two, using only paper (you provide), tape (see below), & string (see below) and a location in the music building transform or create a space. This is a space that the body can travel through or be within and that touches on sound in some way. Ultimately, your goal is to create an sound experience in a space for the participant, *not* an object.

Possible considerations:

- How is this experience for the viewer different at different locations in this space?
- Consider how people currently move through the space.
    - How could you change that?
    - How could you play with scale?
    - How could you play with texture?
    - How could you play with openings?
- Consider how the space currently sounds.
    - How could you change that?
    - How could you highlight different sounds in the space?
    - How could you add new sounds in the space?
    - How could you play with scale?
    - How could you play with texture?
- Consider how you can manipulate the paper;
    - layer it
    - crumble it
    - break it into pieces
    - burn it
    - write/paint on it
    - fold it
    - hang it
    - etc.
    - It has a million affordances.

The goal of this project is to begin thinking about a space, how to create space, and how to control sound in that space.

Forget about technology or making something interactive. Object making tends to be easier than thinking about how to create spaces. This project challenges you to separate from those things, in order to think about space, scale, and sound. This class is all about creating work that takes over or is coupled with a space, not just objects & technology existing in a space/gallery.

Secure the space that you’d like to use. Let me know before the end of class on *Day 2*.

You are required to document your project (demo video, and write-up with images) and submit copies to me by the proceeding Monday after the critique & showing (via email). Your documentation should be placed inside of a zip'd directory, labeled with your names. (i.e. lastName1_lastName2_project1.zip)


## Critical Aspects

We share the music building space with many other people. Space can be tight. Don’t assume that a space will always be empty, just because it is empty when you see it. Many people work in this building. Be mindful of that in your set-up and experiments. Don't assume that your work can just be present in the space for the entire duration. See me if you have a question or issue.

You may not block fire exits, exit signs or paths of egress. You may not block light structures with paper, as the lights get hot.

You may not use color, electronics, or sound. Work within the constraints of this assignment to explore the assignment particulars.

You may not use nails, glue, other tape or other mechanisms of adherence to the building beyond the tape or string given. I will provide the string and tape that you are allowed to use to attach to the space. You are welcome to use other tape/string of your own in the construction of elements that will constitute your work. (i.e. You may only use the blue painters tape and string to connect to the walls/ceiling/floor. Use the painters tape, string, or your own tape/string for paper that is attached only to itself.)

Projects that violate these terms will be removed and will be the responsibility of the student.

You are responsible for removing your project after the critique. It must be removed that evening. Work that is not removed by 11pm will receive a 1/3 letter deduction for every 4 hours it remains in place after the critique.
