# Project 2 -- Cybernetic System as Interactive Installation

- **GRADE:** 20% of your final grade (5% prototype, 15% midterm)


- **Critique: _Week 10 - Week of November 6th (Specifics to come)_**
- Sketch reviews: _Wednesday, October 11th_



Create an interactive system that exists in a space. This system should take input from the space and produce output that is based on that input. This system should take a variety of forms of inputs and create various outputs. Think of these different inputs and outputs as _behaviors_. Your system could be living, breathing and constantly changing. The interaction must be meaningful with the content and the output should be engaging.


The critique will happen in physical space. It will not be you clicking an image on your laptop that is projected. The input and the output must have space in-between, that is utilized conceptually.


This can be playful, deeply conceptual, or an investigation of something. Craftsmanship is important in this piece, as it is not a simple technical exercise. This is not just about a successful technical interaction with software. I expect you to dig deeper than that and to use this system to illustrate a concept. I am looking for a portfolio level piece.


Use some techniques that interest you whether that is physically or conceptually with regard to input and output. You should use individual sketches as the building blocks to your project, which is then a deeper and more thorough investigation of these techniques with an articulated concept that is driving the process of creation.

Your outputs could be visual (graphics, video) or sonic. Your input's could utilize the camera as a sensor and/or physical sensors in the space, or data streams from other means.

Treat each element of your system different. Get each one technically working and working independently. Then, bring the various elements together to work.


## Deliverables for Sketch Reviews

A written post, either online, or in another environment that can be shared digitally (ie. A single webpage, Medium post, Wordpress post, Bear, Pinterest, Evernote, Word, etc.): titled “Project 2 Development” with the following:

- Concept map/Word map of concepts and ideas that you are interested in exploring
- 3-7 different artists, designers, projects, theorists, writers, musicans, poets
- You could use a [storyboard template](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/340-fall2017/tree/master/storyboardTemplates) to sketch out what would happen over time in your piece. What changes? What causes those changes? (highly encouraged)
- What are the inputs and outputs to the piece?
- What spaces are you thinking of using?
- What will the media be in your piece? Collect it now!
- Initial pieces of code. (Remember to break things down into steps)
- Create a simple patch/sketch to trigger or control a video, sound file, or graphics.



## Final Deliverables for Presentation & Critique

- Program Notes or Piece Description
    - Up to 500 words describing the "concepts" of your work. Appropriate for a gallery booklet or wall.
- A zipped folder containing all code, media, installation and presentation instructions, and program notes.

<!--
### Documentation and Paper Deliverable

- Documentation of the final projects: Video and Images showcasing interaction timeline.
- Documentation of things working: Video and Images showcasing development: circuits, working circuits, initial set-ups in space, physical items in those spaces
- Sketches, including initial comic book and subsequent sketches
- Initial working patches and previous versions
