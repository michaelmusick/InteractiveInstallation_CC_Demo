# Project 3 -- Class Collective builds an Interactive Sound Installation

GRADE: 25% of your final grade



- **Public Presentation: _Day 17_**
- **Critique: _Day 18_**
- Sketch reviews: _Day 11_

For the final project, the class will work in 1 or 2 collectives (depending on size) to build a large final installation project. 

This piece should explore issues of interactive theory through sound-based installation. 

I will serve as project manager (PM) for the collective. However, I will not influence ideas or artistic direction. I will simply work to help keep the group on track, take care of logistics, and manage internal deadlines. 

The collective will be required to coalesce around a single artistic idea. Flowing from this, the group will self-assign roles/tasks over the course of the project. 

## Initial Ideation

Initial project ideas and sketches will be completed individually. These will then be presented and discussed by the entire group. Individual ideas will serve as the seeds of a larger idea, which will be hashed out in-class. 

## Install

The install of the work will occur on Day 16.

## Public Presentation

The work will be open to the public the entirety of Day 17 (10am-9pm). Students will need to take a "shift" watching the work.

## Critique

The formal critique will occur the morning of Day 18.

## Strike

Strike will occur in the morning of Day 18, following crit.

## Documentation

Like previous projects, the group will be responsible for submitting a single set of documentation. This is to be completed collaboratively.

*Unlike* previous projects, documentation is due at the time of critique. This means that documentation footage, editing, and writing will need to also occur simultaneously as install and presentation.
