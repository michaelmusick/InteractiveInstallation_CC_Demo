## COURSE OVERVIEW

_Interactive Music 1; Installation, explores the theory and technique of interactive music and art._

What is interactivity? What does it mean to create meaningful interactive experiences? In this hands-on course, students will learn how to create interactive installations and environments, with a primary focus on music and sound. We will talk about what it means to create an interactive experience for general participants. Scale, space, and time will be explored with reference to the body, while creating cybernetic systems for real-time and time-based interaction. Software, electronics, and physical computing will be covered in a workshop style format, with the goal of students creating physical projects. A variety of input and output mechanisms, networking, and best practices will be covered in workshops. Class discussions will cover readings about interactive music/art, design, space, and` installation. Students are free to explore their own ideas/concepts through the lens of this course.

This course will include a mix of reading, discussion, interactive development, projects, and tests.

As this is an intensive course in a developing area, students are expected to be in class and to participate.
