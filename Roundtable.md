# Deliverables for the Roundtable Discussions

Roundtable discussions will take place the week after the MidTerm Project and the Final Project briefs are released. These are in class discussions regarding your ideas for these projects. It’s an opportunity to bounce ideas off the group in order to get good feedback. This ensures a strong project that meets the minimum project requirements while investigating your conceptual interests.

In order to prepare for this presentation and to communicate your ideas to the class succinctly, the following is required for each of these roundtable presentations (MidTerm & Final).

You must have 3 separate/different ideas for EACH roundtable. For each idea present the following:


- Describe the concept in 3 brief sentences
- Show links to 3 other similar works or influences – both technical and conceptual
- [Use the storyboard template provided](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/340-fall2017/tree/master/storyboardTemplates) to describe what the experience is like over time. What does it look like initially? What is the space like? How would I interact with it? How would it react to me? What would that reaction look like? Show the timeline of interactivity: when no one is around, when one person is around, when a group of people are around, when it turns on, when it turns off, how it turns on and off, etc, etc.
- What space would this use on campus?
- For the Final Project only: What is the interface?
