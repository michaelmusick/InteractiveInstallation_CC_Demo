# Show & Tell


## Description 

In the first week, you will either volunteer or be assigned to 2 people from the list below. On the assigned date, bring in 2-3 examples each person/group’s of their work. Each date has at least 2 people/groups. Be familiar with a brief bio and be prepared to critically discuss/analyze the assigned individual and their supporting work in a dynamic presentation in front of the class. Do not be lame. Be informed.

In addition to Googling the people/projects, I encourage you to check out [Eyeo’s website](http://eyeofestival.com) and [Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival), as well as [Creative Applications](http://www.creativeapplications.net) site.


## Notes

- Create a Keynote, Powerpoint or Google Drive presentation.
- Prepare the presentation to be 10-15 minutes TOTAL.
- Prior to your presentation; export it as a PDF.
- E-mail me (mailto:michael.musick@umontana.edu) the presentation PDF, titled with the Artist/Designer names. I will upload this to the course GitHub repo.


## Deliverables

- 10-15 minute presentation of the all of the Artists/Designers allocated for that numeral. Must be prepared, researched and practiced.
- Submit your presentation as a PDF to the GoogleDrive with the Artists/Designers names as the title with the roman numeral.
